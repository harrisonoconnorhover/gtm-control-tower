# Decisions

## BigQuery rather than Snowflake

BigQuery keeps this first portfolio slice small: one SQL setup file, event-oriented storage, and straightforward dbt models. The contracts and marts are portable if a Snowflake version becomes useful later.

## Synthetic first, live connectors second

The public-facing demo must be reliable and safe without exposing credentials or personal/customer data. A deterministic local dataset proves the model; the n8n workflow and warehouse/dbt assets show the real integration boundary.

## Human-approved repairs

Automatic detection is valuable, but destructive merges and lifecycle rewrites should be reviewed. The dashboard therefore separates detection and recommendation from the repair action.

## Append-only event history

CRM state can arrive late or out of order. Keeping immutable source events permits deduplication, reconstruction, and controlled replay without treating the current Salesforce row as complete history.
